# Authorship Statements

This subdirectory should contain the Authorship Statements for publications made with co-authors during your candidature. These forms should be signed **by all authors** and **at the time of publication acceptance**.

The University contains a Microsoft Word copy of the Authorship Statement [here](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/research/your-thesis-and-examinations/forms-and-guidelines), however we advise that you use the A²I² Google Docs template [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LDKBHWtG_LV8v0TPnjjtPMAiorSfe4-B6njSHXIhdyY/edit?usp=sharing) for ease with collaboration. (Click on File -> Make a Copy.)

Keep either the Google Docs or Microsoft Word copies within this directory in addition to static PDF versions that can be attached within your PhD LaTeX thesis.
