# Data

This directory should contain data produced from your candidature, such as results from surveys. These should be synchronised (for archival purposes) onto the Deakin University Research Data Store (RDS). More information about the RDS is available [here](https://www.deakin.edu.au/library/research/manage-data).

You may find guides on how to access the RDS [here](https://support.deakin.edu.au/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0010562), how to create a collection in the RDS [here](https://support.deakin.edu.au/kb_view_customer.do?sysparm_article=KB0010567) and a detailed guide about the RDS is available [here](https://www.deakin.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/253328/Research-Data-Store-User-Guide.pdf).
