# Ethics

This directory should contain approval letters from the SEBE Human Ethics Advisory Group (HEAG) as PDFs. Deakin University's SEBE HEAG [Ethics Approval System](https://deakin365.sharepoint.com/sites/sebe/ethics/SitePages/Online-application-form.aspx) is now online, so do not use existing ethics approval forms. You can use this online system to submit a request for modification of existing approved ethics application.

You may also wish to store relevant certificates relating to [Research Integrity](https://www.deakin.edu.au/students/research/research-support-and-scholarships/integrity-secure) here as well for record-keeping.
