This directory should contain meeting minutes (as a Google Docs format) from each of your PhD supervisor meetings. Name these in a `YYYY-MM-DD.gdoc` format for easy access.

An example template is available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12Y79ci74ykhVJuS7kOQc5ge44owl4E4ntQK8Osy8fRE/edit?usp=sharing).
